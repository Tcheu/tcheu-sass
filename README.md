# tcheu-sass

This is the SASS structure that we use in our projects.
We leave only the components that we use the most.

The folder structure follows the 7-1 pattern described on [sass-guidelin.es](http://sass-guidelin.es/).

The grid system is [Sassgrids](https://github.com/jeromecoupe/sassgrids) by [@jeromecoupe](http://webstoemp.com/).

The hamburger icons are [Hamburgers](https://github.com/jonsuh/hamburgers), by [@jonsuh](https://jonsuh.com).
